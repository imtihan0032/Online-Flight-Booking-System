            <h3>Barcelona</h3>
            <p>The highlights for me are Park Güell (10 EUR), a 45-acre garden complex designed and built between 1900-1914; Sagrada Familia (26 EUR), which has been under construction for over 100 years; Casa Batlló (35 EUR), a project heavily influenced by the Art Nouveau style, and Casa Milà (24 EUR), also known as “La Pedrera” (the Stone Quarry) as the building has a facade of limestone. Barcelona’s old Gothic Quarter is my favorite part of town. It’s where you’ll find the oldest parts of the city — including ancient Roman walls and medieval buildings all connected by narrow, winding streets.Barcelona has one of the best city history museums I’ve ever visited. It contains 4,000 square meters of Roman ruins beneath the city that you can see up close.</p>
