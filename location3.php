            <h3>Thailand</h3>
            <p>The palace is the official residence of the current monarch. Check out Wat Pra Kaeo, which houses the 15th century Emerald Buddha, tons of temples, statues, and beautiful artwork. Bangkok’s weekend market, the largest such market in the world, is an ideal place to buy anything and everything. It has over 15,000 stalls, making it the best place to get gifts, find knockoffs, barter, and eat some good food. A gorgeous Buddhist temple on the Chao Phraya River opposite the Grand Palace. It has one main spire and four small ones and is so iconic that it’s on Thai money.</p>
