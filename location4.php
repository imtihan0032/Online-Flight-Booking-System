            <h3>Tokyo</h3>
            <p>The original Buddhist temple was built in the 7th century and is a quick walk from the Asakusa train station. The current resurrected temple is beautifully painted in rich reds and lives in an oasis of ancient structures, nestled amongst modern skyscrapers, including a five-story pagoda and the famous Kaminarimon aka “Thunder Gate,” constructed in 941. Built in 1957, with many other replica towers being erected country-wide, this bright Eiffel Tower doppelganger stands approximately 333 meters (1,092 feet) and is made entirely out of steel. It was Tokyo’s tallest structure until the “Skytree” was built in 2010. The Imperial Palace is the primary residence of the Emperor of Japan. Built in the late 15th century as a feudal city within the city and inhabited by various warrior clans, Edo Castle, as it was called through most of history, was renamed when the then-Emperor moved Japan’s capital from Kyoto to Tokyo in 1869.</p>
